# Subflow - ModularFlow Game Engine

**Vision:** A progressive, code-first game engine that evolves from friendly script-like logic to full C++ access, helping developers of any level build powerful systems without being locked into drag-and-drop tools.

## Welcome to Subflow ðŸ‘‹
Subflow is a modern, C++-powered game engine framework designed to be learned and extended progressively. It starts with simple, natural-language-style logic and scales up to full access and control over modular C++ systems.

Whether you're new to code or ready to build your own engine modules, Subflow gives you the tools â€” and the learning path â€” to grow with your ideas.

## What is Subflow?
Subflow is a modular, code-first game engine and logic toolkit built in C++ that allows users to:
- Start with easy scripting logic
- Learn by doing (from beginner to advanced)
- Eventually drop down into full C++ if they choose

It is **not** a visual scene editor â€” instead, it focuses on writing clean, understandable, and progressive game logic and systems.

## Why Subflow is Different
- ðŸ’¡ Built to teach and grow with you
- ðŸ§± Fully modular from day one
- ðŸ§  Designed to be understood, edited, and shared
- âœ¨ Built for creativity, not just code

## Who It's For
- Beginners learning C++ and game logic
- Intermediate devs who want reusable patterns
- Indie developers who want full engine control
- Anyone who wants to move past drag-and-drop editors

## Core Features
- Custom prompt/text system
- Modular folders and logic separation
- CMake build system
- GLAD + GLFW rendering pipeline
- Future-focused (scene system, branching dialogue, config loaders)

## ðŸ›  Developer Setup (Jump to Tech)

### Folder Structure
Refer to the top-level structure section above.

### Build Instructions
```bash
# From project root
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Dependencies
- GLFW (3.4)
- GLAD (OpenGL loader)
- CMake (v3.16 or later)
- C++17 compatible compiler

Libraries live in `third_party/` or are linked via CMake modules.

### Technical Design Notes
- Uses modular folder layout under `engine/`
- Dev tools live under `tools/`
- Internal input/output systems are being abstracted
